## JSON API with Hanami ðŸŒ¸

The goal of this project is to provide an example of a JSON API web application built with [Hanami](http://hanamirb.org/) that exposes JWT-protected enpoints.

Main features:

- return a JSON representation of resources
- store encrypted password in the db with [BCrypt](https://github.com/codahale/bcrypt-ruby)
- implement a token based authentication strategy using [Warden Middleware](https://github.com/hassox/warden) and [JWT gem](https://github.com/jwt/ruby-jwt)
- handle [preflight CORS requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS)
- use [Hanami framework](http://hanamirb.org/)

Developed and tested with:

- Ruby v2.3.1
- Hanami v1.0.0beta2

## Try it yourself

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nickgnd/hanami-jwt-example
cd hanami-jwt-example
bundle install
```

then edit `.env.*` files to fit your environment and create the development and test databases

```bash
bundle exec hanami db create
bundle exec hanami db migrate
HANAMI_ENV=test bundle exec db create
HANAMI_ENV=test bundle exec hanami db migrate
```

finally, run tests to check if everything is ok

```bash
rake test
```

The web application exposes an API which allows authenticated users to retrieve a collection of items.
The requests to this endpoint will be authenticated through a token based authentication strategy, passing a custom header `Authorization` containing the user's JWT.


Let's start.

```bash
bundle exec hanami server
```

By default it launches the development server at `http://localhost:2300`

1) **Before we need to register a new user**

To do this, we have to make a `POST` request against `/registration` endpoint passing the required informations in the payload.

_request_:`POST /registration`

_payload_:

```bash
{ user: { email: "hanami@exmaple.com", password: "cherryblossom", password_confirmation: "cherryblossom" } }
```

_with curl_:
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "user": { "email": "hanami@exmaple.com", "password": "cherryblossom", "password_confirmation": "cherryblossom" } }' "http://localhost:2300/registration"
```

2) **Retrive user's jwt**

For retrieving the JWT, we have to make a `POST` request to `/sessions` path passing user's email and password in the payload.

_request_: `POST /sessions`

_payload_:
```bash
{ user: { email: "hanami@exmaple.com", password: "cherryblossom" } }
```

The response body will contain the JWT under the key `auth_token`, save it for the next step (retrieving item collections).

_with curl_:
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -d '{ "user": { "email": "hanami@exmaple.com", "password": "cherryblossom" } }' "http://localhost:2300/sessions"
```

Response example:

```bash
{"auth_token":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxNCwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cDovL2ludmVudG9yeS5jb20iLCJleHAiOjE0ODkwNDUxNDB9.RI2F5-6rsIU02yXa158iocRP2qKQoR-mi8jbsRM0mDo"}
```

3) **Retrieving items**

Finally, for retrieving the items we have to make a `GET` request against `/items` endpoint including the user's jwt in the headers.

_request_: `GET /items`

_headers_:
`"Authentication": "Bearer <YOUR_JWT>"`

_with curl_:
```bash
curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_JWT>" "http://localhost:2300/items"
```

The response body will be an empty array because there are not items in the database, let's create a new one through the Hanami console:

```bash
bundle exec hanami console
```

```bash
item = Item.new(code: 'alfa', available: true)
=> #<Item:0x007fa66b2da7d0 @attributes={:code=>"alfa", :available=>true}>

ItemRepository.new.create(item)
=> #<Item:0x007fa66e040e18 @attributes={:id=>1, :code=>"alfa", :available=>true, :created_at=>2017-03-08 23:00:11 UTC, :updated_at=>2017-03-08 23:00:11 UTC}>
```

Now the next request will return the item just created

```bash
[
  { "id":1,"code":"alfa","available":true,"created_at":"2017-03-08 23:00:11 UTC","updated_at":"2017-03-08 23:00:11 UTC" }
]
```

et voilÃ !
